A short demo on how to create old school sine wave text from the demoscene in 80s and 90s.

We use a spritesheet font to have controll over each character. Then we can also use the script and font for any kind of text. The text would not require to be made in photshop or any other image software.

This script are limited to the english alphabet (a-z) lower cap letters only. This is because of the spritesheet I have made of the c64 font.
